Red Carrot Notes
========

Add a visual separator in the ExpressionEngine entry edit screen to break up field groups without relying on tabs. You can customise the colour and add as many as you want in a channel.

## Changing Settings
* Each time you add a field you have the choice to add a large title, a description line and a custom HEX colour code.
* You can also change the padding size in the field type preferences (Addons > Field Types)
